        <p>
            VersionOne IssueSync for JIRA (formerly known as the VersionOne Integration for JIRA) creates Stories and Defects in VersionOne based on Issues orginating in JIRA. Using this integration, your organization
            can manage and triage issues reported by customers and promote them to VersionOne for the product team to address.

        </h2>

        <p>
            For agile development teams using JIRA and VersionOne, and who need
            to integrate their issue management with agile project management,
            VersionOne IssueSync for JIRA is an integration that transforms
            JIRA Issues into Workitems (Defects or Stories) in VersionOne. Using this
            integration, an organization can manage and triage issues reported
            by customers and promote them to VersionOne for prioritization,
            estimation, planning, and implementation. When the work is completed in VersionOne, the integration updates JIRA to reflect the resolved status.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the integration is installed and configured, JIRA users can specify which issues require engineering attention and those issues will
            automatically appear as Workitems in VersionOne.
            Additionally, when the Workitems are closed in VersionOne, the
            integration updates the JIRA Issue to reflect this change. JIRA
            issues that require engineering attention are identified using
            JIRA filters.
        </p>

        <p>
            The following sequence diagram illustrates how the integration interacts with
            JIRA and VersionOne.<div class="wsd" wsd_style="qsd">

                    The integration can be installed on any Windows system with HTTP access to
                    both VersionOne and JIRA. Exact placement should be determined by
                    your internal software management requirements. The integration
                    system must meet the System Requirements stated above.

        <p>
            This section describes how to modify your JIRA instance for use
            with the integration. Before you begin, you need decide if you want to
            the Assign or Label method to indicate the JIRA issues you want visible in VersionOne.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Select or Create a JIRA User
                <p>
                    The integration requires a valid JIRA User ID and a Password in order to connect to JIRA. This user must have sufficient rights to accept work and modify issues (i.e. must be assigned to the Developer Role on the project). This user must also have rights to the actions being performed by the integration (for example, the user must have rights to close Issues).</p>
                <p class='info'>
                    Although the integration does not require administrator
                    access to run, there are some validation rules that can only be
                    checked with a JIRA Administrator role. To help check first-time
                    configuration, the recommended approach is to elevate the
                    integration user to Administrator. After the integration has been
                    verified (start the integration in the below steps) and before
                    starting as a service (install as Windows Service in the below
                    steps), reduce the JIRA access to the Developer Role. Then you can
                    safely ignore log warnings about validation rules that require
                    administrator access.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Create Filters for Defects and Stories
                <p class='info'>
                    These filters must be available through the
                    credentials used by the integration; hence, it is recommended that
                    you create these filters using the same credentials to avoid the
                    complexity of shared filters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of a JIRA filter are used to determine which JIRA
                    Issues will be transferred to VersionOne. By using a JIRA filter,
                    you can make the integration fit with your existing JIRA workflow
                    and fields. The details of writing such a filter are beyond the
                    scope of this document; however, the following are some simple
                    examples.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type and Status Filter
						<p>
                            The simplest Filter is to move all JIRA Issues of a certain type
							and state to VersionOne.<br />
                            <a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRA_TypeAndStatusFilter.png" title="Type and Status Filter">
                                <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_typeandstatusfilter.png" /></a> 
                    </li>
                    <li>Assigned User
						Filter <p>
                            If only a subset of JIRA Issues of a type and status should be moved, then you may want to create a Filter that transfers all JIRA Issues that are associated with a specified user.<br />

                            <a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRA_AssignedUserFilter.png" title="User Filter">
                                <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_assigneduserfilter.png" />
                            </a>&nbsp;
                            </p>
                            <p class='info'>
                                This method is not supported when integrating with JIRA 5.2 or earlier.</p>                        
                    </li>
                    <li>Label Filter
						<p>
                            Another method of transferring only a subset of JIRA Issues of a type and status would be to create a Filter that transfers all JIRA Issues that are labeled with &quot;versionone&quot; or some other value you or your organization designates. <br /><a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRA_LabelFilter.png" title="Label Filter">
                            <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_labelfilter.png" /> </a>
                        </p>
                        <p class='info'>
                                Please note that the label value must already exist on an Issue in order to create this type of Filter.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    <li>Custom Field or Combination                                   
                        <p>
                            If the JIRA fields above would conflict with existing
                            workflow, you may want to create a Custom Field and use it
                            as part of the Filter.<br />

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Create a Custom Field to hold the URL to the VersionOne Workitem.
				<p>By default the integration puts the VersionOne Workitem information in the &quot;Comments&quot; section of the Issue. This information includes a URL to the VersionOne Workitem. You may optionally add another field to hold this data as necessary. To do this create the JIRA Custom Field and note the &#39;fieldId&#39; value in the JIRA URL. This value is available to the JIRA Administrator. </strong> </span><a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRACustomField.png" title="JIRA Custom Field"></p>

            <li>Determine where to store the JIRA ID

                    The integration needs a text field in VersionOne to store the JIRA
					identifier; by default this is the <em><strong>Reference</strong></em> field. If you
					are already using this field, you'll need to create a custom text

            <li>Map your Projects
				<p>
                    Project Mapping allows you to specify where 
                    Workitems are created in
					VersionOne. The algorithm for selecting a project is as follows:
					First, the integration looks for the JIRA Project Name in the map.
					If it exists, the Workitem is created in the corresponding VersionOne
					Project. If the JIRA Project Name is not found, the integration
					attempts to find a VersionOne Project with the same name. If found,
					the integration creates the Workitem in the VersionOne Project with a
					matching name. If it cannot find a VersionOne Project with a name
					that matches the JIRA Project, the integration will create the
					Workitem in the root level node of the VersionOne Project Tree or in
					the first project in the list if there are multiple top level
					nodes.<br />

                </p>
                <p>To add a Project Mapping you need to do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the <b>Project and Priority Mappings</b> tab
                    </li>
                    <li>In the Project Mapping grid, select a VersionOne Project
						value from the dropdown list.</li>
                    <li>Supply the corresponding JIRA Project name.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>To
						remove a mapping:
                    Select the desired row.</li>
                    <li>Click the Delete selected row button</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Map your Priority Values
				<p>
                    Priority 
                    mapping allows you to configure how the VersionOne Workitem
					priority value is set based on the JIRA Priority value. The
					algorithm for mapping is simple, if the JIRA Priority value is in
					the mapping, the VersionOne Workitem priority value is set to the mapped
					value. If the JIRA Priority value is not found, the VersionOne
					Worktiem priority value is not set.<br />
