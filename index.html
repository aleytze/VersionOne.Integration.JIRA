        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The VersionOne Integration for JIRA creates stories and defects in VersionOne based on issues found in JIRA. Using this integration, your organization 
            can manage and triage issues reported by customers and promote them to VersionOne.

        <p>
            JIRA is an Atlassian product for issue tracking, commonly used for both defect and issue tracking. As an issue tracking system, JIRA helps
			quality assurance and programmers keep track of reported software
			bugs in their work. JIRA also allows users to enter bug reports
			directly (depending on configuration) although it is often used only
			internally in a company or organization doing software development.
			As an issue tracking system, JIRA manages the broader notion of
			issues needed by an organization. In this context, JIRA may be used
			in an organization's customer support call center to create, update,
			and resolve reported customer issues, or even issues reported by that
			organization's other employees.
        </p>

        <p>
            For agile development teams using JIRA and VersionOne, who need
			to integrate their issue management with agile project management,
			the VersionOne Integration fir JIRA is a bridge that transfers
			issues in JIRA into defects or stories in VersionOne. The integration creates
			defects or stories in VersionOne based on issues in JIRA. Using this
			integration, your organization can manage and triage issues reported
			by customers and promote them to VersionOne for prioritization,
			estimation, planning, and implementation once you determine
			development work is necessary. When the work is completed in
			VersionOne, the integration updates JIRA to reflect this change.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once the integration is installed and configured, JIRA users
			can specify which issues require engineering attention and they will
			automatically appear as stories or defects in VersionOne.
			Additionally, when the story or defect is closed in VersionOne, the
			integration updates the JIRA issue to reflect this change. JIRA
			issues that require engineering attention are identified using
			filters.
        </p>

            The following sequence diagram illustrates how the integration interacts with
			JIRA and VersionOne.<br />

        </h3>

        <p>
            This section describes how to modify your JIRA instance for use
			with VersionOne. Before you begin you need decide if you want to
			Assign or Tag the JIRA Issues you want visible in VersionOne.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Select or Create a JIRA User.
				<p>
                    The integration requires a valid JIRA User ID and a Password
					in order to connect. This user must have sufficient rights to
					accept work and modify issues (i.e. must be assigned to the
					Developer Role on the project). This user must also have rights to
					the actions being performed by the integration (for example, the
					user must have rights to Close Issues). The default value in
					configuration is username &quot;remote&quot; and password
					&quot;remote&quot; but these can be changed to suit your needs.
                </p>
                <p class='info'>
                    Although the integration does not require administrator
					access to run, there are some validation rules that can only be
					checked with a JIRA administrator role. To help check first-time
					configuration, the recommended approach is to elevate the
					integration user to Administrator. After the integration has been
					verified (start the integration in the below steps) and before
					starting as a service (install as Windows Service in the below
					steps), reduce the JIRA access to Developer Role. Then you can
					safely ignore log warnings about validation rules that require
					administrator access.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>Create Filters for Defect and Story
				<p class='info'>
                    These filters must be available through the
					credentials used by the integration; hence, it is recommended that
					you create these filters using the same credentials to avoid the
					complexity of shared filters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The results of a JIRA filter are used to determine which JIRA
					issues will be transferred to VersionOne. By using a JIRA filter,
					you can make the integration fit with your existing JIRA workflow
					and fields. The details of writing such a filter are beyond the
					scope of this document; however, the following are some simple
					examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    *NOTE: A separate filter is needed for creating a Defect in VersionOne and for creating a Story in VersionOne.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type and Status Filter
						<p>
                            The simplest filter is to move all JIRA Issues of a certain type
							and state to VersionOne.<br />
                            <a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRA_TypeAndStatusFilter.png" title="Type and Status Filter">
                                <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_typeandstatusfilter.png" /></a> 
                    </li>
                    <li>Assigned User or Label Filter
						<p>
                            If only a subset of JIRA Issues of a type and status should be
							moved, then you may want to create a filter that transfers all
							JIRA Issues that are associated with the remote user, or you may
							want to create a filter that transfers all JIRA Issues that are
							labeled with &quot;versionone&quot;. Please note that the label value must already exist on an Issue in order to create this type of filter. <br />

                            <a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRA_AssignedUserFilter.png" title="User Filter">
                                <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_assigneduserfilter.png" /></a>&nbsp;<br /><br />

                                <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_labelfilter.png" /></a></p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Custom Field or Combination
						<p>
                            If the JIRA fields above would conflict with existing
							workflow, you may want to create a custom field and use it
							as part of the filter.<br />

                            <a class="fancybox" href="screenshots/JIRA_CustomFieldFilter.png" title="Custom Field">
                                <img alt="" src="thumbnails/jira_customfieldfilter.png" /></a>

                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Do you need a custom field to hold a URL to the VersionOne
				Asset?
				<p>
                    By default the integration puts the VersionOne defect information
					in the &quot;Comments&quot; section of the Issue. This information
					includes a URL to the VersionOne asset. You may optionally add
					another field to hold this data necessary. To do this create the
					custom field and note the 'fieldId' value in the URL. This value is available
					to the JIRA Administrator. From the &quot;View Custom Fields&quot;
					page, select the &quot;Screens&quot; link under the settings &quot;gear&quot; for the desired custom field.<br />

            <li>Determine where to store the JIRA ID
				<p>
                    The integration needs a text field in VersionOne to store the JIRA
					identifier; by default this is the <em>Reference</em> field. If you
					are already using this field, you'll need to create a custom text
					field in VersionOne and note the name.

            <li>Map your Projects
				<p>
                    Project Mapping allows you to specify where Defects and Stories are created in
					VersionOne. The algorithm for selecting a project is as follows:
					First, the integration looks for the JIRA Project Name in the map.
					If it exists, the Defect/Story is created in the corresponding VersionOne
					project. If the JIRA Project Name is not found, the integration
					attempts to find a VersionOne Project with the same name. If found,
					the integration creates the Defect/Story in the VersionOne project with a
					matching name. If it cannot find a VersionOne project with a name
					that matches the JIRA Project, the integration will create the
					Defect/Story in the root level node of the VersionOne Project Tree or in
					the first project in the list if there are multiple top level
					nodes.<br />

                    </a>
                </p>
                <p>To add a Project Mapping you need to do the following:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the <b>Project and Priority Mappings</b> tab
                    </li>
                    <li>In the Project Mapping grid, select a VersionOne Project
						value from the dropdown list.</li>
                    <li>Supply the corresponding JIRA Project name.<br />
                    </li>
                    <li>To
						remove a mapping:
                    Select the desired row.</li>
                    <li>Click the Delete selected row button</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Map your Priority Values
				<p>
                    Priority mapping allows you to configure how the VersionOne defect
					priority value is set based on the JIRA Priority value. The
					algorithm for mapping is simple, if the JIRA Priority value is in
					the mapping, the VersionOne defect value is set to the mapped
					value. If the JIRA Priority value is not found, the VersionOne
					defect value is not set.<br />
